# Study Workspace

`study/algorithm/`: Problem notes and solutions for algorithms.  
`study/data_structures/`: References and implementations for key data structures.

### Workflow
- Keep each problem in its own Markdown file; drop a matching Python solution when needed.
- Use the Python template in `algorithm/template.py` for quick stdin-based problems.
- Jot patterns, invariants, and edge cases in the Markdown alongside code to build a personal handbook.

### Recommended practices
- For each problem, record the idea, complexity, and tricky cases before coding.
- Add small test cases in the Markdown or as inline examples in the Python file.
- Favor readability first; optimize after you have correctness.
