# Algorithms

- Keep one problem per Markdown file (e.g., `01_two_sum.md`) paired with code (e.g., `01_two_sum.py`).
- Use `template.py` as a quick start for stdin-style problems.
- Track complexity and edge cases in the Markdown before and after coding.

## Quick commands
- Run a solution: `python your_file.py < input.txt`
- Format (optional): `python -m pip install black && black your_file.py`
- Type check (optional): `python -m pip install mypy && mypy your_file.py`
