# Linked List

- Essentials: insert/delete, reversal (iterative/recursive), merge, split.
- Detection: cycle detection (Floyd), intersection, palindrome check with mid-split.
- Variants: doubly linked list, skip list concepts.

Store reusable node definitions and helpers in `implementations/`. Use `problems/` for worked examples and edge-case notes.
