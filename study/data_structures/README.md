# Data Structures Roadmap

Organized study tracks with space for notes, implementations, and problems. Fill each subfolder as you learn; keep one concept per Markdown where possible.

## Folders
- `01_arrays_strings/`: Sliding window, two pointers, prefix/suffix tricks, string hashing.
- `02_stack_queue/`: Stack-based monotonic patterns, queue simulations, deque usage.
- `03_linked_list/`: Pointer manipulation, cycle detection, reversal patterns.
- `04_hash_table/`: Collision strategies, custom hashing, frequency maps.
- `05_heap_priority_queue/`: Heaps for scheduling, k-selection, lazy deletion.
- `06_tree/`: Traversals, recursion patterns, BST, segment/fenwick trees.
- `07_graph/`: BFS/DFS templates, shortest paths, connectivity, topological order.

## Suggested usage
- Add concise summaries in each `README.md` to remind yourself of go-to patterns.
- Keep core code in `implementations/`, references and takeaways in `notes/`, and solved exercises in `problems/` with Markdown writeups and code.
- Record edge cases and invariants alongside code; link problems to the patterns they use.
