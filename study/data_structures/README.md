# Data Structures

Use this folder for implementations, notes, and small tests.

Suggested Markdown files:
- `arrays.md`: prefix sums, sliding window, two pointers.
- `trees.md`: traversals, LCA templates, segment/fenwick trees.
- `graphs.md`: BFS/DFS patterns, shortest paths, connectivity.
- `hashing.md`: collision handling, rolling hash snippets.
- `misc.md`: queues, stacks, heaps, union-find, and amortized analysis notes.

Tips:
- Keep a small suite of example inputs/outputs with explanations.
- Note invariants and typical pitfalls (off-by-one, indexing, overflow).
- If you add Python implementations, name them alongside the notes (e.g., `segment_tree.py`).
