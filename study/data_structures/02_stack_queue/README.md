# Stack & Queue

- Patterns: monotonic stack/queue, next greater element, histogram, parentheses validation.
- Data structures: deque operations, circular buffers, min/max stack.
- Watch for: underflow checks, index tracking, amortized vs worst-case behavior.

Implement reusable snippets in `implementations/` and collect problem notes in `problems/`.
