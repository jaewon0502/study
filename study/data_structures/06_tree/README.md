# Tree

- Traversals: DFS/BFS orders, recursion vs iterative, Euler tour.
- BST: insert/delete, balance considerations, order statistics.
- Range structures: segment tree, fenwick tree, lazy propagation basics.
- Other topics: tree DP, LCA (binary lifting), centroid ideas.

Maintain reusable templates in `implementations/`; record problem-specific tricks in `problems/`.
