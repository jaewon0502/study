# Graph

- Traversals: BFS/DFS templates, connectivity, cycle detection.
- Shortest paths: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, 0-1 BFS.
- Structures: adjacency list/matrix, edge list; directed vs undirected nuances.
- Patterns: topological sort, SCC (Kosaraju/Tarjan), MST (Kruskal/Prim).
- Pitfalls: indexing, visited resets between components, negative cycles.

Place reusable graph routines in `implementations/` and annotate problem notes in `problems/`.
