# Arrays & Strings

- Core tools: prefix/suffix sums, two pointers, sliding window, difference arrays.
- String topics: hashing, z-function, KMP, trie basics.
- Track common pitfalls: off-by-one, window boundaries, Unicode vs ASCII assumptions.

Fill `implementations/` with reusable helpers (e.g., sliding window skeleton). Use `problems/` for writeups and solutions.
