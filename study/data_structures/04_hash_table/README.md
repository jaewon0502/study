# Hash Table

- Topics: open addressing vs chaining, load factor management, custom hash for pairs/strings.
- Algorithms: frequency maps, two-sum style lookups, deduplication.
- Pitfalls: collisions, modulo bias, poor hash seeds, deletion handling in open addressing.

Keep standard map patterns in `implementations/`; log interesting problems and counterexamples in `problems/`.
