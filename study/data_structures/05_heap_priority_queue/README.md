# Heap & Priority Queue

- Uses: k-smallest/largest, scheduling, Dijkstra, streaming medians.
- Techniques: lazy deletion, heapify, custom comparators, multi-heap tricks.
- Watch for: 1-index vs 0-index heaps, comparator inversion, stale entries.

Put base heap wrappers in `implementations/` and solved tasks in `problems/` with notes on complexity and edge cases.
